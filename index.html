    <p>I am currently a junior at the University of Puget Sound majoring in Computer Science with an intended Business minor. 
      I was born in Los Angeles in february 2001 and lived there until I started attending UPS. 
      I got my first taste of computer science during the second semester of my freshman year at UPS. 
      I found that I like the feeling of creating a working program so much that I could bear the frustration that comes with actually writing the program. 
    </p>
    <p>Back home in Los Angeles I spent most of my life outdoors, either at the beach or playing some field sport. 
      My favorite sports to play are Soccer and Baseball, however I do enjoy watching all forms of competition. 
      Another activity that I enjoy is scuba diving. Every summer, except for these last two due to Covid, me and my family would travel to tropical locations for vacation and diving.
    </p>
    <p>My ultimate goal in life is to be able to move back home to Los Angeles and be able to live comfortably in a nice home.
      Right now, my goal is to finish my education and get my degree.
      I am not sure at the moment what exact kind of work I wanna do in the computer science field but I am continuing to explore and learn about all the different options that I could strive towards.
