    <h1>Who is Martin Freeman? <img src="Images/me.png" alt="Martin Freeman smiling headshot", width="175px"></h1>
    <p>I am currently a junior at the University of Puget Sound majoring in Computer Science with an intended Business minor. 
      I was born in Los Angeles in february 2001 and lived there until I started attending UPS. I spent most of my life outdoors, either at the beach or playing some field sport. 
      My favorite sports to play are Soccer and Baseball, however I do enjoy watching all forms of competition. 
      Another activity that I enjoy is scuba diving. Every summer, except for these last two due to Covid, me and my family would travel to tropical locations for vacation and diving.
